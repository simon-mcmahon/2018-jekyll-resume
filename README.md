# Archived 2018 resume Jekyll website

Note that this is an **ARCHIVE** of a previous version of my resume website. As such it isn't maintained, shouldn't be run and may have security issues.

This is the repository archive of the Github pages resume website I used in 2018. It was accessible at [simonmcmahon.com](https://simonmcmahon.com). I am replacing it with something capable of hosting a blog as well.

It featured a professional looking blue theme, responsive design for mobile, a simple 1-page design.

I added a few features myself, including the:
* `PDF resume` button with a link to a [PDF version](/assets/sm_resume.pdf) of my resume for easy printing.
* `Add to Contacts` button which had a `.vcf` file so people could add my details to their solution of choice.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Desktop</th>
    <th>Mobile</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <img src="/assets/fullpage-desktop-screenshot.png?raw=true" width="600"/>
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="/assets/mobile-screenshot.png?raw=true" width="250"/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It was a fork of the great [Jekyll theme from sharu725](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/). Many thanks for helping this amateur web developer have a professional online presence.
